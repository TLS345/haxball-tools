# Day 14/60 - Goodbyes
_By TLS / Teleese_

## 🎯 Description
A Haxball addon that transforms players' exits into cinematic events.  
Each command triggers a unique farewell sequence — funny, over-the-top.
## 🕹️ Available Commands
- `!bb` or `!nv` → Classic exit with a heroic tone.  
- `!mellamamimama` → When your mom calls and there’s no escape.  
- `!acomer` → Food always comes first.  
- `!mequitaronlacompu` → The eternal battle: family vs. Wi-Fi.

## 💡 How to Use
Paste the code (Goodbyes.js) into your main Haxball room script (below your `onPlayerChat` events).  
No setup needed — it just works.
