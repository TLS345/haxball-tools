# Haxball Tools 🚀  
*A mega-repository containing 60 different Haxball utilities*

## 💡 What is this?
This repository consolidates **60 independent Haxball tools** — each originally developed as a standalone project.  
The goal is to keep **all tools organized in one place**, preserving their full commit history for easier maintenance, versioning, and sharing.

## 📦 Repository Structure
```

haxball-tools/
├─ haxball-tools-1/
├─ haxball-tools-2/
├─ …
├─ haxball-tools-60/
└─ README.md

````

Each folder `haxball-tools-N/` contains one original project, including its source code and preserved history.

## ✅ What’s Included?
- 60 unique Haxball utilities (bots, scripts, automations, tools, etc.)
- Full commit history from every original repository
- Clean and consistent folder layout

> ℹ️ **Note:** This is a **consolidation**, not a rewrite.  
> All tools remain unmodified unless explicitly updated.

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists
- To avoid maintaining **60 separate repositories**
- To simplify cloning, sharing, and versioning everything at once
- To make future refactoring or improvements much easier
- To keep a clean, organized archive of all past Haxball tools

## 🛠️ How to Clone & Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TLS345/haxball-tools.git
cd haxball-tools
````

From there, enter any tool’s folder to view or use it.

## 📁 Project Structure (Inside Each Tool Folder)

Each tool preserves its original structure:

* Original source code
* Original README (if it had one)
* Assets, configs, and other files
* Full commit history

Nothing was altered unless necessary.

## 🤝 Contributing

If you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Submit a pull request explaining which tool you modified and why

New tools are welcome too — just ensure they are tested and placed in their own numbered folder.

## 📝 Notes & Limitations

* Some tools may be outdated or rely on older library versions
* Not all tools are guaranteed to work perfectly today
* Each tool is intended to be used independently
* If a tool is deprecated, consider updating or rewriting it before use
